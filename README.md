### Workflow

The dev branch is used for developing. When we want to make new commits, we create a new feature branch, push the commits and make a pull request to merge the feature branch into dev branch. The dev branch might contain bugs due to merge conflicts. We can fix the issues with dev and merge dev into main once a week. Since we don't commit directly to dev and main, the main branch will keep bug-free and the bugs on dev branch will be easy to fix.


make new feature branch -> commit to feature branch -> request to merge into dev -> merge dev into main
